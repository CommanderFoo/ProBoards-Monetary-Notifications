This is an official addon to the Monetary System and Monetary Shop.

This plugin will show notifications to the user when they receive a donation, trade request, or a member of staff has modified their money.

It comes with default templates to choose between, however it also allows you to create and style your own.

This plugin is to be used with the Monetary System (minimum version 0.9.0) and Shop (minimum version 0.5.5), and will also require Yootil 1.0.0 or higher:
